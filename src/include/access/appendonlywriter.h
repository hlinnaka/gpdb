 *   - UTILITY mode operations, for example, gp_restore.
 *   - Table rewrites that are sometimes done as a part of ALTER TABLE.
 *   - CTAS, which runs on an exclusively locked destination table.

 * be updated for segment entry 0 after the operation completes. This is ok
 * as the concurrency module never cares about the RESERVED segno anyway. When
